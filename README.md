## Profile

I build reliable full-stack systems with a strong backend foundation.

My focus is on clean APIs, predictable data flow, and frontend applications that stay simple as complexity grows. I work across the stack but prioritize system stability, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

## What I work on

- Full-stack web applications
- Backend APIs and data services
- MERN-based products
- React and Next.js frontends
- Scalable application architecture

I prefer building systems that are easy to reason about, test, and extend.

## Technical expertise

### Frontend
- React - Next.js - TypeScript - JavaScript - Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- Node.js - Express.js - REST APIs - Authentication and authorization - Business logic and data validation

### Full-stack (MERN)
- MongoDB - Express.js - React - Node.js

## How I approach development

- I design APIs before UI
- I keep logic explicit and predictable
- I separate concerns early
- I value readability over cleverness
- I optimize only when needed

Good systems stay understandable as they grow.

- Real application structure
- Backend-first thinking
- Clean frontend integration
- Practical full-stack patterns
- Code meant for production, not demos

## Tools & workflow
